Module "LineCam"   (component BitIO_LDD)
   - LineCam_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - LineCam_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - LineCam_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).
   - LineCam_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - LineCam_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "CLCK"      (component PWM)
   - CLCK_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - FFFF 
                value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined 
                values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer possibilities and on 
                the selected period.
   - CLCK_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - CLCK_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU1_GetPeriodTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks before re-initialization. See also method <SetPeriodTicks>. This 
                method is available only if the property <"Counter restart"> is switched to 'on-match' value.
   - TU1_GetCounterValue -Returns the content of counter register. This method can be used both if counter is enabled and if 
                counter is disabled. The method is not available if HW doesn't allow reading of the counter.
   - TU1_SetOffsetTicks -Sets the new offset value to channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. It is user responsibility 
                to use value below selected period. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
   - TU1_GetOffsetTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks to compare match channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. 
                See also method <SetOffsetTicks>. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
   - TU1_SelectOutputAction -Sets the type of compare match and counter overflow action on channel output. This method is 
                available when at least one channel is configured.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL25Z128LK4)
